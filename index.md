## I made a thing!

I loved big screen blaseball, but it's not really built to show 12 games at a time. So I spent a bit of time reworking a few things, removing some stuff, moving things around, and ended up with what we've got here!

Big thanks to cepheus for [BIG SCREEN Blaseball](https://holmesmr.github.io/Blaseball-Userstyles/#big-screen-blaseball), which you'll need installed to use this userstyle!

## Instructions

* Follow the easy to follow instructions to install [BIG SCREEN Blaseball](https://holmesmr.github.io/Blaseball-Userstyles/#instructions)

* [Click Here to Install Compact BSB](styles/compact-bsb.user.css)

## Troubleshooting

* Try deleting the blaseball styles and reinstalling them! Remember to install [BIG SCREEN Blaseball](https://holmesmr.github.io/Blaseball-Userstyles/#big-screen-blaseball) first, and then [Compact BSB](styles/compact-bsb.user.css)

* I believe there is another commonly used userstyle, `Big Blaseball`, that is not compatible with CompactBSB

## Recent Updates

* Fix for homepage game widget

* Displays play counter

* NOW INCLUDES SHARK ATTACKS (The graphic for the shark attacks should display as of v 0.0.13)

* Small light mode fixes (v0.0.14)

## Comparisons

A few screenshots to compare between layouts for normal blaseball, BIG SCREEN Blaseball, and BIG SCREEN Blaseball + Compact BSB

## Consumer Contrast

I thought I could help make the CONSUMERS stand out a bit more! After you've got stylish installed, you can [click here to install Consumer Contrast](styles/sharkglow.user.css) which should (hopefully) work with any (or no) userstyles! Works in light mode too!
